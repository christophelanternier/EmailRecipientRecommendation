#### Hand-crafted approach:

Simply run wether handcrafted.py or handcrafted.ipynb according to your preferences, in order to get the predictions made by our handcrafted approach. (Both do the same)

#### Learning approach

First you need to compute all features on the training set. To do so simply use learning_computing_features.ipynb or learning_computing_features.py. (Takes about an hour). If you change the save variable to “True”, features will be saved in a file ../data/

Then you can run learning_make_prediction.ipynb or learning_make_prediction.py to make predictions on the test set.
